 * that resolves to the function's return value.
 *
 * The SWC worklet transform replaces the `fn` argument with a worklet context

 * (dev warning in non-production builds).
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const animate = runOnMainThread((x: number) => {
 *   'main thread'
 *   element.setStyleProperty('opacity', String(x))
 * })
 * await animate(0.5) // executes on Main Thread
