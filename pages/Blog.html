React 18 (18.2.0) skips renders in Safari even when props change","body":"It seems that React 18 in Safari is not rendering every render call when the props have changed. \r\n\r\nIt is possible that I don't understand something about React 18's rendering, however, this is not reproducible in React 17 (or in React 18 without `createRoot`) or in React 18 with Firefox or Chrome, which leads me to think that this is a bug.\r\n\r\nReact version: 18.2.0\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n- a component that uses state to remember previous props\r\n- quickly call render on a React18 `createRoot`

I'd love to help explain this bug, or learn what I'm doing wrong. Thanks!\r\n\r\n## Explanation of linked code repository\r\n\r\nThis is from [React18SafariSkipRenderPropsChanged](https://github.com/evanbernstein/React18SafariSkipRenderPropsChanged)'s README:\r\n\r\nThis is either a demonstration of a bug with React 18 (18.2.0) in Safari, or a demonstration of\r\nhow I don't quite understand React rendering.\r\n\r\nIt seems that React 18 in Safari is not always rendering every render call, even if the props have\r\nchanged. Is this a bug?\r\n\r\nThis is a very small portion of a React/Typescript/Python game that I've been coding. This is a\r\nvery trimmed down demonstration of the bug.\r\n\r\nThe game displays a text log of the players' actions. These messages get sent from the server,\r\nusually one at a time. Sometimes these messages arrive in quick succession, ms apart. I don't have\r\nthe game server send all of the log messages every time, only the latest message. So the log needs\r\nto retain previous messages to have them continue to be displayed to the user.\r\n\r\nIn this bug demonstration app there are two Components:\r\n\r\n- [LogWithState](https://github.com/evanbernstein/React18SafariSkipRenderPropsChanged/blob/main/src/LogWithState.tsx) is the simplification of the Log from my game. It uses\r\n  state to remember previous messages and then loops through all the messages to display them.\r\n- [LogWithoutState](https://github.com/evanbernstein/React18SafariSkipRenderPropsChanged/blob/main/src/LogWithoutState.tsx) takes an array of messages and loops through and\r\n  displays them all. This is a workaround solution for React 18 rendering in Safari. For this to\r\n  work, the app remembers the list of previous messages in Typescript not in the React component.\r\n\r\n[LogWithState](https://github.com/evanbernstein/React18SafariSkipRenderPropsChanged/blob/main/src/LogWithState.tsx) uses `useState` to record the full list of messages in the\r\n`Log` component. This worked fine with React17's render call. When I upgraded to React18 and\r\n`createRoot` I noticed that log messages were sometimes missing. Recently I discovered that this is\r\nnot reproducible in Firefox or Chrome, but is easily reproducible in Safari 16.4 and Safari Mobile\r\niOS 16.4.1 (the latest versions as of 2023-04-21) both on my devices and on at least one other device.\r\n\r\nThe html for this demo has two root nodes for react. We use `ReactDOM` from React 17 to render into\r\n`react17-root`. We use `createRoot` and React 18's `render` to render into `react18-root`.\r\n\r\nIn the React 17 dom we render [LogWithState](https://github.com/evanbernstein/React18SafariSkipRenderPropsChanged/blob/main/src/LogWithState.tsx) to demonstrate that this works fine.\r\n\r\nIn the React 18 dom, we render two different components. [LogWithState](https://github.com/evanbernstein/React18SafariSkipRenderPropsChanged/blob/main/src/LogWithState.tsx) and [LogWithoutState](https://github.com/evanbernstein/React18SafariSkipRenderPropsChanged/blob/main/src/LogWithoutState.tsx).\r\n\r\nAs you can hopefully see for yourself, \"LogWithState - React 17\" and \"LogWithoutState - React 18\"\r\ndisplay all 10 of the log messages. \"LogWithState - React 18\" should be missing some of the logs.\r\nBelow is an example screenshot on my machine:\r\n\r\n![screenshot of the bug in action](https://github.com/evanbernstein/React18SafariSkipRenderPropsChanged/raw/main/bug-screenshot.png)\r\n","bodyText":"It seems that React 18 in Safari is not rendering every render call when the props have changed.\nIt is possible that I don't understand something about React 18's rendering, however, this is not reproducible in React 17 (or in React 18 without createRoot) or in React 18 with Firefox or Chrome, which leads me to think that this is a bug.\nReact version: 18.2.0\nSteps To Reproduce\n\na component that uses state to remember previous props\nquickly call render on a React18 createRoot and view the app in latest Safari (desktop or mobile)\nyou will see that react sometimes skips renders and the state of the component will be missing some of the props that should have been passed in.\n\nThis behavior is not reproducible in React 17 or in React 18 with Firefox or Chrome.\nLink to code example: React18SafariSkipRenderPropsChanged is a github repo that demonstrates this bug.
